Exercise 1:
    
Committing Multiple Files

The staging area can hold changes from any number
of files that you want to commit as a single
snapshot.

1. Add some text to ingredients.txt
   (e.g. limes)

2. Create a new instructions.txt file explaining
   how to use the ingredients together.

3. Add changes from both files to the staging
   area, and commit those changes.
